Thank you for visiting this hub.

Good day, 

What you can find here are the components of my blog, updated almost daily.

You can visit the site by clicking this link: [https://sinbad989.github.io/](https://sinbad989.github.io/). 

I have a limited memory and tend to be unorganized when I doing projects and in studying. To remedy this short-coming I started a blog. This blog serves as a guide to where I'm heading and where I've been. In addition, the blog served as a historical record of all the things that done.
