I have a limited memory and an unorganized habit of doing projects and studies. To remedy this short-coming, I started a github blog. This blog will serve as a guide to where I'm heading and to where I've been. In addition,the blog act as a historical record of all the things that I have achieved so far, because there are days I am will be sad, I need to remind myself what I have achieved more than I could remember.
