Thank you for visiting this hub.

Good day, 

What you can find here are the components of my blog, updated almost daily.

You can visit the site by clicking this link: [https://sinbad989.github.io/](https://sinbad989.github.io/). 

I have limited memory and have an unorganized habit of doing projects and studies. To remedy this short-coming I started a blog. This blog serves as a guide to where I'm heading and where I've been. In addition, the blog serves as a historical record of all the things that I've done.
