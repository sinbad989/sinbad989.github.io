I just completed my Coursera course in <b>Deep Learning Specialization!!</b>

**Courses offered:**
1. ~~Neural Networks and Deep Learning~~
2. ~~Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regulization, and Optimization~~ 
3. ~~Structuring Machine Learning Projects~~
4. Convolutional Neural Networks
5. Sequence Models

These courses were very informative. One fundamental idea that one needs to remember is that neural networks are made up of a units of linear regression. And it was natural to start the course with the evaluation and examination of a linear regression. And from there scale it up to a single layer standard neural network, and scale it up more to invoke hidden layers. Deep neural network is just basically a neural network with more than two hidden layers. 


Each course offers an effective message: **"Machine learning is a very empirical process!"** This implies the importance of experimentation on different parameters and hyperparameters. Ng stressed the importance of regularization and use of a different optimization algorithm both in weight updates and weight initialization.
