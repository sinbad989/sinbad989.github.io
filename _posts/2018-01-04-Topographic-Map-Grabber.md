I started exploring the 1:2500,000 scale map in NAMRIA website. The site contains treasure trove of information concerning an area. They are old, but some information are relevant. </p>

The box of scale 1:250,000 is made of smaller tiles of scale 1:50,000. It was annoying clicking the box because of the small resolution. I decided to let <a href="https://github.com/sinbad989/Python_Programming/tree/master/TopoMapGrabber">python script</a> do it for me. I downloaded all the map of resolution 1:50,000.


<p>An example of the map available,</p>
