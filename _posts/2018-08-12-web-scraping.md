## Open-Source Tools

### 1. Requests 

- Response content
- Binary response content
- JSON response content
- Raw response content

### 2. BeautifulSoup

BeautifulSoup transforms a complex HTML document into a complex tree of python objects. You'll deal only with four kinds of this objects. 

1. **Tag**: 
   it corresponds to an XML or HTML tag in the original document 
   Important topic to explore: 
   1.1 Navigating the tree
   1.2 Searching the tree
2. **NavigableString**: 
  A string corresponds to a bit of text within a tag. Beautiful Soup uses the NavigableString class to contain these bits of text:
3. **BeautifulSoup**:
  The BeautifulSoup object itself represents the document as a whole. For most purposes, you can treat it as a Tag object. This means it supports most of the methods described in Navigating the tree and Searching the tree.
4. **Comment**:
  Tag, NavigableString, and BeautifulSoup cover almost everything you’ll see in an HTML or XML file, but there are a few leftover bits. The only one you’ll probably ever need to worry about is the comment. The Comment object is just a special type of NavigableString.
