Way back in the past when Einstein was the talk of the daily newpaper, Dirac initiated the idea that almost all chemistry problems where solve with the introduction of the quantum wave equation of Schrodinger. He said, 
> The underlying physical laws necessary for the mathematical theory of a large part of physics and the whole of chemistry are thus completely known, and the difficulty is only that the exact application of these laws leads to equations much too complicated to be soluble. It therefore becomes desirable that approximate practical methods of applying quantum mechanics should be developed, which can lead to an explanation of the main features of complex atomic systems without too much computation.

Around 1927, years after the introduction of the Schrodinger equation, Born and Oppenheimer introduced some approximation on the Schrodinger equation for many-electron system. This was the only solution to get away from the complexity of the equation. The main idea was to pretend that the nuclei were in its static configuration on the whole duration of the existence of the electron and let the electron do the motion. This reduces the Schrodinger equation down to the Hartree's formulation of what is now known as Hartree equation. 

This Hartree equation where then further improved with the addition of the anti-symmetry principle of electrons. With this was the introduction of a new term in the equation, now known as the exchange term capable of removing the unphysical quantities appearing in hartree equation.
